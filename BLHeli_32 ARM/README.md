## Test code

The folder "Rev32.7.3 Variable PWM frequency testcode" contains test code that supports 
variable pwm frequency. You can configure motor pwm frequency to increase with throttle.
The benefits of variable pwm frequency are:
- Low frequency for low throttle gives good active braking where it is most needed
- High frequency for higher throttle makes running smoother
- The variable frequency will work as dithering making running even more smooth

This test code also has several fixes.

Note that for the latest functionality you will also need the latest version of BLHeliSuite32.
